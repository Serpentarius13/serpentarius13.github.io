# Hello world!

It works! Hosted with Github Pages & Deployed with Github Actions.

I upgraded a bit to my taste with DaisyUI as I don't really like Shadcn for personal stuff.

I want to add some more features & tweak the design a little bit, so that's probably the next steps.
Also, I will soon publish my first article on the path I took to actually deploy such a project from scratch:
inspirations, template, UI-lib, deploy and so on.
